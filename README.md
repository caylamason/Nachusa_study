# Nachusa_study
Code for Nachusa Grasslands soil microbiome project

Sequencing data are compositional in nature. Here, I used a compositional data analysis approach to perform differential abundance of soil metagenomes and orthologs to understand the microbial and functional changes associated with land use transition and restoration practices. As the sites were sampled multiple times, I used linear mixed effects modeling to account for repeated measures.
